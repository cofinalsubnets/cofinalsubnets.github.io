      <h1>programming languages</h1>
      <p>
        programming languages are a hobby of mine. here's a few that i made.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/wisp">Wisp</a> (2013)</h2>
      <p>
        my first real lisp! written in Haskell during the winter 2013 batch at Recurse Center (at the time
        called Hacker School). i had already messed around a little bit with Common Lisp due to StumpWM and
        had just been introduced to SICP. Wisp was intended to be the scripting language for a
        player-programmable MUD i was writing, but it ultimately grew to eclipse the rest of the project.
        apart from being written in Haskell and running inside a text-based multiplayer game, it was a pretty
        standard interpreted Lisp-1. one slightly unusual feature was automatic currying.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/shimmre">Shimmre</a> (2014)</h2>
      <p>
        a self-hosting parser generator language written in CoffeeScript, for some reason! inspired by Ometa.
        you would write a grammar in Shimmre and provide transformation rules in a host language, and Shimmre
        would generate host language code. it had JavaScript and Ruby backends. 
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/gus">Gus</a> (2015)</h2>
      <p>
        i wanted to write another Lisp, in C this time. Gus was a single C file Lisp interpreter named after
        a coworker's cute dog. it used a very standard mark-and-sweep garbage collector.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/mattie">Mattie</a> (2016)</h2>
      <p>
        a kind of weird experimental string-centric esolang, based on parsing expression grammars, like Shimmre.
        Mattie (named after <a href="../an/mattie.html">my dear cat</a>) was written in Scheme with a syntax based on
        Shimmre's metagrammar, but rather than generating host language code it was entirely based around transforming strings.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/lisa">Lisa</a> (2020)</h2>
      <p>
        aka Lips. originally meant to be an experiment in FORTH-like languages, it turned into another Lisp written
        in C, but this time with much cooler features: copying garbage collection, a self-hosting threaded code
        compiler, actual compile-time macros, and a very stripped-down syntax based on just 5 special forms.
        still in development!
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/lisa/blob/main/test/k2.la">K2</a> (2022)</h2>
      <p>
        a microKanren derivative written in Lisa that came out of my research into relational languages at Oso. being based on
        microKanren it's obviously extremely minimal. the main innovation is to represent result streams uniformly as
        Church-encoded lists, which removes a layer of runtime reflection; on the other hand it creates a lot more closures,
        so the performance picture is complicated. even so i think it's a very aesthetic approach to take! it would be much
        less tolerable in Scheme, but Lisa's lambda syntax is so clean it's basically transparent.
      </p>

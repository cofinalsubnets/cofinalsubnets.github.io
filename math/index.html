      <h1>math page ðŸ§®</h1>
      <p>welcome to my page about math and related concepts.
        i am definitely not a real mathematician!
        i slept through my classes in high school and college
        and am quite lazy with little taste for rigor.

        to me, math is not a body of knowledge about some particular thing.
        instead it's a name the culture gives to questions that have been
        posed (and hopefully answered) with a sufficient level of clarity
        and detail. often numbers are involved, because they naturally
        appear when you operate at this level of precision, and are essential
        to certain generic concepts like uniqueness and repetition.
        but they're not always the main thing.

        anyway that's a digression, sorry! this page is just the index.
        collected here are writings about "math things." they aren't
        novel or particularly insightful and i mostly wrote them for
        my own information and enjoyment.

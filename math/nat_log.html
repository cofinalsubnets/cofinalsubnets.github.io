      <h1>"natural" logarithm?</h1>
      <p>
        what makes the natural logarithm "natural"? it's <em>not</em> the
        fact that logarithms at other bases differ from natural logarithms
        by a constant factor. a little algebra shows that if \( e \) has
        this property, then so does every other base.
      </p>
      <p>
        \[
        \log_x n = \frac{\ln n}{\ln x}
        \implies \frac{\log_x n}{\log_x y}
        = \frac{\frac{\ln n}{\ln x}}{\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}}
        = \frac{\ln n}{\ln y} = \log_y n
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        natural logarithms are "natural" because they appear in contexts
        that don't explicitly invoke \( e \), or even the concept of
        exponentiation. the first of these is in the study of the
        very simple differential equation \( \frac{dx}{dt} = x \).
        swapping the denominator and integrating both sides gives
      </p>
      <p>
        \[
        \int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x} = \int_0^t \mathrm{d}t \implies \ln x = t \implies x = e^t
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        which is your basic exponental growth formula.
      </p>
      <p>
        buried in there is the fact that the natural logarithm is the
        integral of \( \frac{1}{x} \), which to my mind gives the reason
        to call them "natural": they can be calculated easily by taking the
        area under the curve from 1 to the argument, which is approximated
        well (for large numbers) by a prefix of the harmonic series. this
        amounts to Riemann sum on the curve with partition width 1 and its
        difference from the true integral is bounded by the Euler-Mascheroni
        constant, which is a little over 0.577. the wonderful old-timey name
        for this operation is "quadrature of the hyperbola" and it gives
        another tantalizing hint about "where \( e \) comes from" that's
        different from the usual limit of Bernoulli's compound interest
        formula.

      <h1>cheez sauce</h1>
      <p>
        this is the best vegan cheez sauce recipe i've found! it's perfect for mac and
        cheez, but it's also thick enough that you can use it as a condiment or spread.
        i usually make it with cornstarch, because it's easier to find and less expensive
        than arrowroot. if you have arrowroot starch, it will give a stretchier, more
        cheeselike texture.
      </p>
      <h2>ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3c/2 coconut milk (the unsweetened kind from a can)</li>
        <li>6T nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>4T starch (cornstarch is fine, but ideally arrowroot or tapioca)</li>
        <li>t salt</li>
        <li>t onion powder</li>
        <li>t/2 garlic powder</li>
        <li>t/4 smoked paprika</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>directions</h2>
      <p>
        mix everything in a saucepan and stir constantly over medium heat until thickened.
        it'll firm up as it cools, but will relax if you mix it into (hot) cooked pasta.

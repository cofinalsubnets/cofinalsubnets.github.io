      <h1>peanut butter cookies</h1>
      <p>
        these cookies really shine with virgin coconut oil! refined won't give the same
        flavor; in that case you might as well use butter. the pb:oil ratio is based on Earth
        Balance coconut &amp; peanut spread, which you can use to replace them both if you want,
        if you can find it; in that case you will probably want to add less (or no) salt, and
        less sugar since it's already sweetened.
      </p>
      <p>
        these don't need gluten to hold the batter together, so i usually make them using
        non-wheat flour of some kind. teff and buckwheat both give a very nice color contrast
        to the peanut chunks. but you can use regular flour too, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        if you don't have turbinado sugar for the topping, you can use brown sugar, or just skip it.

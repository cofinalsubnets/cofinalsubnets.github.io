      <h1>notes on ingredients</h1>
      <h2>vegan eggs and dairy</h2>
      <p>i'm vegan, so none of my recipes use eggs or milk, but of course you can of substitute them if you want.</p>
      <p>if a recipe calls for "milk" or "milklike" then any plant milk is suitable unless otherwise
      specified; generally oat or soy is best imo. in recipes that call for mixing milk with vinegar to
      make "buttermilk", higher-fat plant milk is preferable. almond milk is usually my last choice.
      all the recipes assume you're using unsweetened milk.</p>
      <p>if a recipe calls for "butter" then any plant-based butter or margarine-type thing is fine,
      although the recipes assume that whatever you're using is unsalted, so adjust the extra salt accordingly.
      you can also use coconut oil. refined coconut oil tastes like nothing and can be used anywhere; virgin coconut oil
      tastes like coconuts and is great in desserts but might be a little weird in other things.</p>
      <p>if a recipe calls for "egg" or "egglike" then there's several good options. in all cases one unit egglike is about c/4.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a mix of 3 parts water and 1 part flax meal is good for most purposes.
        ideally you would make this ahead of time and let it refrigerate for a while, but i usually
        make it on the spot &amp; it's fine.</li>
        <li>mashed banana or pumpkin, or applesauce is good for sweet things like cake or enriched bread.</li>
        <li>aquafaba, the water left over from cooking beans, is an excellent choice for most baked goods
        and particularly for anything that would ordinarily call for egg whites (you can even
        make meringue and mayonnaise with it!). the water from canned chickpeas is perfect for this. other
        types of beans give a stronger flavor which is usually not good, but sometimes is ok (eg. in black bean
        brownies).</li>
        <li>if you have them both, mixing flax meal and aquafaba makes kind of a "deluxe" egglike. i would use this in
        challah bread for example (along with maybe half a banana).</li>
        <li>if there's nothing else available, mixing a tablespoon or two of starch with water is better than nothing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>flour</h2>
      <p>there's so many different kinds of flour! the big division is between wheat and its relatives, which have gluten,
      and other plants that are gluten-free.</p>
      <h3>wheat</h3>
      <p>most people can eat gluten just fine and for them the health benefits of a gluten-free diet are massively overstated.
      gluten is a miracle protein, don't give it up for no reason! ALL wheat flour contains gluten, as do rye and spelt flours,
      although the composition is different in the latter and some people who have trouble digesting wheat gluten have an
      easier time with spelt. spelt flour is also just delicious!</p>
      <p>the difference between "bread flour", "all-purpose flour", and "pastry flour" is the gluten content.
      bread flour or "hard" flour is high-gluten, to make the dough extra elastic and able to retain carbon dioxide during
      fermentation; otherwise the gas would escape and the bread would end up too dense and chewy. high gluten is also important
      for pasta: if you ever looked at the ingredients on a box of pasta and saw "durum wheat" or something like that,
      "durum" means "hard" as in high-gluten.</p>
      <p>pastry flour or "soft" flour has less gluten, which makes the finished product lighter and less tough. most pastries
      and desserts use chemical leavening, so the dough/batter doesn't need to hold in gas for long periods of time. this is
      also the kind of flour you would prefer for savory quickbreads like biscuits.</p>
      <p>and all-purpose flour is just what it says on the bag.
      unfortunately in a lot of places it's hard to find specialized types of flour so this might be all you can get.
      and unless you're trying to be a gourmet baker it's more convenient not to worry about different flours anyway.
      if all you can find is all-purpose, don't stress, it's probably fine for whatever you're trying to make.
      just knead a little more for bread, or don't overmix for other things, and it'll come out ok.</p>
      <h3>gluten-free</h3>
      <p>this is a very coarse classification. grains outside the wheat family don't have gluten, and plenty of things that get
      ground into flour aren't even grains, so this category covers an extremely wide range of different foodstuffs. not having
      gluten means they can't make elastic dough like wheat flour. that doesn't matter much in a lot of recipes, especially for
      sweets where the sugar or fat holds the batter together. peanut butter cookies are a great example: you can use practically
      any kind of flour for these since the peanut butter gives the batter its stiffness.</p>
      <p>there's also "gluten-free flour blends", which are usually a mixture of flours like rice or sorghum, together with
      starch, and often a thickener like xanthan gum. i've never made bread with these, but they're good for pastries. they
      tend to dry out faster than wheat flour though, and can have kind of a gummy texture. best consumed fresh!</p>
      <p>here's a few non-wheat flours that i've used:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>buckwheat</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          it's called buckwheat but it's not wheat. it has a striking dark brown color.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>coconut</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          an example of a non-grain "flour". coconut flour is delicious and amazingly good at soaking up moisture.
          so if you have a batter that's too wet, it can be a good thing to add. i like adding 10% or so to
          cake &amp; cookie flour mixes for the flavor, but if you use too much, it can make things dry.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>sorghum</strong></dt>
        <dd>has a very nice mild flavor and a light unobtrusive color. i like it a lot for all kinds of GF pastries.</dt>
        <dt><strong>teff</strong></dt>
        <dd>teff is an African grain that's used to make injira, the ubiquitous floppy flatbread of Ethiopian cuisine.
        it has a lovely golden-brown color that IMO is even prettier than buckwheat.</dd>

      <h1>delexicalizations</h1>
      <p>
        lexicalization means naming.
        a lexicalization gives a name to a meaning.
        in English, this can be powerful, but also confusing.
        the new name is like a boat.
        on the boat, the meaning can drift.
        many simple English words are names for complicated ideas.
        so sometimes, when people use the same word, they mean different things.
        but because the word is the same, they can't tell.
        this causes confusion, and sometimes even conflict.

      <p>
        a definition is lexicalizes and also delexicalizes.
        it gives a name to an idea.
        it also gives the ideas behind a name.
        this is what dictionary does.

      <h1>programming languages ðŸ’»</h1>
      <p>
        Programming languages are a big hobby of mine! Here's a few that I made:
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/wisp">Wisp</a> (2013)</h2>
      <p>
        My first real Lisp! Written in Haskell during the Winter 2013 batch at
        <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> (at the time called Hacker School).
        I had already messed around a little bit with Common Lisp due to
        <a href="http://stumpwm.github.io/">StumpWM</a> and had just been introduced to
        <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html">SICP</a>.
        Wisp was intended to be the scripting language for a player-programmable MUD I was writing,
        but it quickly became the focus of the project. Semantically it's a fairly standard Lisp-1,
        but the implementation is a little odd since (a) it's in Haskell, (b) it runs inside a text-based
        multiplayer game, and (c) I had no idea what I was doing! One slightly unusual feature though was
        automatic currying.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/shimmre">Shimmre</a> (2014)</h2>
      <p>
        A self-describing parser generator language inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMeta">OMeta</a>
        and written as a blog post in literate CoffeeScript (because at my last job the CTO said CoffeeScript was the
        future; I guess the subsequent explosion of languages-that-compile-to-JavaScript proved him sort of right).
        You would write a grammar in Shimmre and provide transformation rules in a host language, and Shimmre would
        generate host language code. It had working JavaScript and Ruby backends. Shimmre was my first "compiled"
        language, and IMO it's still kind of cool. I'll probably rewrite it in plain JS one of these days.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/gus">Gus</a> (2015)</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to write another Lisp, in C this time. Gus is a single-C-file Lisp interpreter named after
        a coworker's cute dog. It uses a mark-and-sweep garbage collector that I more or less copied
        conceptually from Ian Piumarta's <a href="https://piumarta.com/software/maru/">Maru</a>.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/mattie">Mattie</a> (2016)</h2>
      <p>
        Kind of a weird experimental string-centric esolang, based on parsing expression grammars, like Shimmre.
        Mattie (named after <a href="../../an/mattie.html">my dear cat</a>) was written in Scheme with a syntax based on
        Shimmre's metagrammar. It's entirely based around transforming strings. One of those languages that makes
        you go "is this really Turing complete?"
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/lisa">Lisa</a> (2020)</h2>
      <p>
        Also known as Lips. Originally written as a FORTH-like stack language, it turned into another Lisp written in C,
        but this time with much cooler features: copying garbage collection, a self-hosting threaded code compiler,
        actual compile-time macros, and a stripped-down syntax based on just 5 special forms. Still in development.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gw000/lisa/blob/main/test/k2.la">K2</a> (2022)</h2>
      <p>
        A <a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf">microKanren</a> derivative written in Lisa
        that came out of my research into relational languages at Oso. Being based on microKanren it's very minimal. The main
        innovation is to represent result streams uniformly as Church-encoded lists, which removes a layer of runtime
        reflection; on the other hand it creates more closures, so the performance picture is unclear. Even so i think it's a
        very aesthetic approach to take! It would be less tolerable in Scheme, but Lisa's lambda syntax is so clean it's
        basically transparent. The heart of Lisa's type checker, as soon as I get around to writing it ðŸ˜…

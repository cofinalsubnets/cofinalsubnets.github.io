      <h1>Abraham's Psycho God</h1>
      <p>
        the God of Abraham &mdash;
        <span dir="rtl">×™×”×•×”</span>,
        Jehovah,
        <span dir="rtl">Ù±Ù„Ù„ÙŽÙ‘Ù°Ù‡</span>,
        the LORD;
        vengeful sky-father prototype,
        worshipped and feared by billions of orthodox Jews, Christians, and Muslims &mdash;
        is insanity itself.

        he is not <span dir="rtl">Ø£ÙƒØ¨Ø±</span>;
        he is not á¼€Î³Î¬Ï€Î·;
        he is certainly not Î»ÏŒÎ³Î¿Ï‚.

        he represents the very abandonment of sound mind, good conduct, and personal responsibility.

        this is explicitly manifest in one of the first stories in the Bible,
        also present (though slightly modified to be even worse) in the Quran;
        a story so appalling that even religious believers who have no qualms
        about consigning most of their fellow humans to eternal torment in hell
        tend to de-emphasize and apologize for it:
        the tale of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac (resp. Ishmael) on Mt. Moriah.
      </p>
      <p>
        the conventional interpretation of this story
        is that God imposed the evil task on his servant Abraham to test latter's faith:
        when he proved willing to kill his own child to please the voice in his head,
        Abraham displayed praiseworthy faithfulness and obedience to his God.

        the ramifications of this telling are clear and horrendous:
        right and wrong, real and unreal, good and evil,
        all depend from the vaporous whimsy of a heavenly tyrant
        whose delight it is to test and trick you.

        the heart and mind of the human worshipper are worse than worthless;
        only God's will determines what is right;
        he may abrogate the rules, or turn them upside down, at any time;
        he may freely decree that two and two make five.

        you have no guide, and there is none to help you decide
        which voice belongs to God,
        and which comes from the adversary,
        or your own deceitful heart.

        choose wisely, o thou mortal worm.
      </p>
      <p>
        this doctrine is fatal to independent thought,
        and it echoes throughout the Abrahamic orthodoxies:

        in the Roman church's imperious catechism,
        delivered in autoparodically magisterial Latinate register,
        by old men in pompous costume,
        from the ancient palazzi of Jesus' killers;

        in the Quran's monotonous recital
        of Muhammad's reign of paranoid terror over his mystified followers,
        required to memorize every evil awaiting them on the Day of the Law
        should they let their taqwa slip;

        in the pathetic lickspittle pleading throughout the Psalms
        that YHWH may take pity on his faithful servant,
        who loves his law and has never once departed from his ways,
        and yearns to smash Babylon's babies on the rocks.

        it represents the original sin, so to speak, of this strain of religious experience:
        the individual <strong>may not</strong> be trusted;
        only God's authority is legitimate;
        but God being absent, his will must naturally be actuated
        through the Sanhedrin, or the Vatican, or the Caliphate, or your squalid local presbytery.
        once an individual's trust in their own faculties has been voided,
        they can be filled with the authority of the religious state.
        they will make an excellent drone.
      </p>
      <p>
        apologists will probably claim that i miss the point of this story.  they will say:

        &ldquo;what is to be overcome by the believer is not, as you say, their own moral and mental faculties;
        but the holding out, so to speak, against God.
        they must give <em>everything</em> to God, as Abraham gave his most precious thing.
        such is the perfection of faith.&rdquo;

        this is pure euphemism.

        Abraham was not required by God to abstain from his favorite food or forego music and dance:
        he was ordered to murder his child to appease an invisible spirit.

        if it was a test, then Abraham failed,
        if not by the standards of Psycho God,
        then by any reasonable standard whatsoever;
        and so has every zealot, crusader, or jihadi who has murdered in the name of Psycho God;
        and so has Psycho God himself.
        may heaven rescue us from Psycho God!
      </p>
      <p>
        here is the ultimate counterargument:
        anyone who follows Abraham's example,
        we call a lunatic.

        the psycho servants of Psycho God who torture and kill to please him,
        we call marauders and terrorists.

        they are the fruit of this tree.

        even C.S. Lewis, arch-apologist confabulator that he was,
        wrote at one point that it would do no good
        to worship a God whose morality is opposite our own.

        but, arch-apologist confabulator that he was,
        he failed to observe that this description applies perfectly
        to the God he professed to worship.
      </p>
      <p>
        listen, you apologists for madness:
        it is possible to acknowledge the finitude of human wisdom
        without discarding it.

        it is possible to be humble and realistic
        about one's limited intellectual and moral understanding,
        without foreswearing them entirely.

        to submit to Psycho God is to abandon all reason and discernment,
        the sole miracles by which we can see or say anything at all.

        it is like cutting off your legs, to force yourself to fly.

        to the lost and lonely individual
        seeking answers about the world and their place in it,
        it represents the temptation to replace self-responsibility
        with blind obedience to earthly religious authority.

        to the religious authority, it represents the means
        by which the individual as such may be defeated,
        assimilated, and brought within social control.
      </p>
      <p>
        the Bible holds contrary glimmers of conscious faith
        that doesn't require the believer to demolish their own heart and mind.

        many of Jesus' parables appeal to people's natural intellect
        to illuminate and reveal the tawdry myths of the religious ruling class.

        consider the parable of the talents: the one who buries their gift in the ground,
        and afterwards presents it unused as proof of their faithfulness, is not rewarded.

        remember that God sees every sparrow that falls from the sky: yet among his people,
        he must delegate to clerics and functionaries?

        reflect that you who are foolish, do not light a candle, and cover it with a basket:
        then why does God, who is wise, place a light in your mind, and ask you to extinguish it?
      </p>
      <p>
        but this light, to all appearances, has been overcome by darkness in the souls of those who claim to
        walk in light. to most people, "religion" is synonymous with "faith", and "faith" is a cheap ersatz for understanding:
        a matter of corporal obedience to rules, when necessary, and otherwise, of reciting approved formulas. it is faith first
        of all in humans' pretensions to holiness: the church, the law, the community of the faithful. all letter, no spirit.
        nothing to free the mind or cleanse the heart, and nothing to impugn the malignant caprice of Abraham's Psycho God.
